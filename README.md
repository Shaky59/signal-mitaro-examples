# Signal Mitaro (信号みた郎)

Robust industrial PNP signal acquisition board  
→ Structured event generation  
→ Multi-path communication (Wi-Fi / Bluetooth / CAN / Satellite)

This repository contains early design documents and reference examples.

**Industrial PNP signals → Structured Events → Multi-path Communication**

This repository provides reference examples for:
- ESP32 / Raspberry Pi / Arduino
- Wi-Fi / Bluetooth / CAN / Satellite (Iridium)

> Status: **Phase 0 (early development)**  
> Hardware is under development. This repo focuses on **concept + event format + minimal examples**.

## Concept Illustration
(coming soon)

## Quick Start
- Level 0: GPIO → JSON events (serial)
- Level 1: Wi-Fi/BLE → send events
- Level 2: Satellite → queued delivery (optional)

## License
TBD
